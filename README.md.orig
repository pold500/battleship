#####Original tutorial is for cocos2d-iphone, and this implementation is in cocos2d-x#####


##Purpose##
I've done this project to learn cocos2d-x after having several projects done in cocos2d-iphone. This is my first project in cocos2d-x, so I'm sure there are things to improve.

######I'm making this project public just in case it might save some time for someone else.######

######Don't expect something great :)######
